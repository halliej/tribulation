# Tribulation

This is a HTML5/Javascript version of the classic board game that I wrote because my wife and sister-in-law loved this game when they were kids and I needed some practice using Canvas. This is a single player version that will play on desktop and mobile. You can play offline if you make a homepage shortcut to the app.
